- 👋 Hi, I'm @cristiancr20
- 👀 I'm still interested in learning about programming and how web pages, applications, etc. work.
- 🌱 I am currently learning React, I would like to learn more about all the technology that works on the Frontend.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate in some professional work, with companies, whether large or small, to learn from people who know what this world of programming is like and to be able to put their teachings into practice
